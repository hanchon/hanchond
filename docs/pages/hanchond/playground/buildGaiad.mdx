# Build Gaiad

To run a cosmos-hub node the `gaiad` binary is required.

:::info
Instead of building from the source code, the process gets the release from the GitHub release page.

## Download the binary

The `build-gaiad` command supports the flag `--version` to build a specific tag. It defaults to version `v18.1.0`. It also supports the `--is-darwin` flag to download the binary for MacOS `arm` or Debian `amd64` (it defaults to `true`)

```sh
hanchond playground build-gaiad
Downloading gaiad from github: v18.1.0
Gaiad is now available
```
