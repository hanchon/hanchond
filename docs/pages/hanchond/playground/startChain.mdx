# Start Chain

After running the `init-chain` command, you can start the chain.

## Start all the nodes

Running the `start-chain` command will run all the validators associated with the chain.

The command requires an integer as a parameter that represents the chain id.

```sh
hanchond playground init-chain 1 --client evmos --version local
Node added with ID: 1
Node added with ID: 2
New chain created with id: 1
```

:::info
The node logs can be found inside the home folder `data/${chain_id}-${node_id}/run.log`.
