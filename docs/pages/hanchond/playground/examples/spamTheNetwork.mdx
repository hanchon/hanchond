# Spam the Network

To simulate network usage, we are going to deploy a couple of erc20 tokens and move them between accounts.

## Init the network

```bash
hanchond p remove-data && hanchond p init-chain 1 --version v18.1.0 && hanchond p start-chain 1
```

## Get the node info

```bash
hanchond p get-node 1

Node: 1
General Configuration:
    - Binary: evmosdv18.1.0
    - ChainID: evmos_9001-1
Process:
    - IsRunning: 1
    - ProcessID: 3932
    Keys:
        - KeyName: validator-key-1-0
        - Mnemonic: crush tone naive tobacco expect deliver inflict ten gate ride used thought guide defense gather nuclear sniff achieve notice labor maid torch sword piano
    Ports:
    - 8545(web3): 53864
    - 26657(cli/tendermint): 53868
    - 1317(cosmos rest): 53860
```

We need the mnemonic and the web3 port from that list.

## Send the transactions

```go
go run examples/erc20/main.go "crush tone naive tobacco expect deliver inflict ten gate ride used thought guide defense gather nuclear sniff achieve notice labor maid torch sword piano" "http://localhost:53864" "/Users/hanchon/.hanchond"
