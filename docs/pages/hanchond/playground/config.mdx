# Configuration

The playground needs a folder to store the network data, the flag `--home` can be used to change the default value.

By default, the playground data will be stored at `$HOME/.hanchond`

```go
hanchond playground --home /home/hanchon/.hanchond
```

:::danger
The `--home` flag must be used in all the `playground` commands, if the flag is not present it will default to `$HOME/.hanchond`
