# Add Chain Configuration

To run a relayer between two chains, first you need to set up the configuration for both chains.

If you are running with just local chains, the `hermesAddChannel` command takes care of everything. But if you need to communicate with chains that are outside the networks created by `hanchond`, you need to manually add both chains and call the `create-channel` command.

## Parameters

To add a configuration you must send the following parameters as flags:

- `chainid`: Chain-id, i.e., `evmos_9001-2`
- `p26657`: Endpoint where the port 26657 is exposed, i.e., `http://localhost:26657`
- `p9090`: Endpoint where the port 9090 is exposed, i.e., `http://localhost:9090`
- `keyname`: Key name, it's used to identify the files inside Hermes, i.e., `relayerkey`
- `keymnemonic`: Key mnemonic, mnemonic for the wallet
- `prefix`: Prefix for the bech32 address, i.e, `osmo`
- `denom`: Denomination of the base token, i.e, `aevmos`
- `is-evm`: If the chain is EVM compatible, this is used to determinate the type of wallet.

```bash
hanchond playground relayer add-chain-config \
    --chainid=evmos_9001-2 \
    --p26657=http://localhost:26657 \
    --p9090=http://localhost:9090 \
    --keyname=evmosrelayer \
    --keymnemonic="attend recipe own funny garden fiber glad inherit loud skull kangaroo swing license visual learn explain economy best news sibling float video disorder prepare" \
    --prefix="evmos" \
    --denom="aevmos" \
    --is-evm=true
