# Change Binary Version

When performing an upgrade, you can use the `change-version` command to change the chain binary version.

The `change-version` command requires 2 parameters:

- ID (It can be node ID or chain ID, depending on the `--is-chain-id` flag)
- Version

```sh
hanchond playground change-version 1 local --is-chain-id false
Node 1 updated to version local
```

:::info
`local` is a valid version when the local built is needed.

The `--is-chain-id` flag can be used with the value `true` when you want to update all the chain node versions. If you only need to update one node, you can ignore the flag or send it with the value `false`.
