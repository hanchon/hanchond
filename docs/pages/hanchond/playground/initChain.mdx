# Init Chain

Before starting the chain, a genesis file needs to be created and the configurations files need to be updated.

## Set up the genesis and config files

Running the `init-chain` command will set up the genesis file and update the configuration files so the ports do not conflict with the rest of your network.

The command requires an integer as a parameter that represents the amount of validator that will be set up.

```sh
hanchond playground init-chain 1 --client evmos --version local
Node added with ID: 1
Node added with ID: 2
New chain created with id: 1
```

:::info
By default the `--version` flag will be `local`, it can be overwritten with any of the versions that were previously built.

By default the `--client` flag will be `evmos`. `gaia` is also supported.

By default the `--chainid` flag will be `evmos_9001-X` or `cosmoshub-X`, depending on the client.
