# Remove Data

To start a new playground, you first need to remove old data.

```sh
hanchond playground remove-data
Stoping all the running nodes...
Stoping the relayer...
Cleaning up the data...
```

The `remove-data` command will remove the data folder for your playground, the only files that are kept are the built binaries.

:::info
Removing the data will try to STOP the currently running processes before deleting the disk data.
