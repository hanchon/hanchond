# Build Solc

To compile solidity contracts, you need to have a solidity compiler. The `build-solc` command allows you to download the version of `solc` that you need.

## Download the solidity compiler

The `build-solc` command supports the flag `--version` to download a specific release. It defaults to version `0.8.0`.

```sh
hanchond playground build-solc --version 0.8.1
Downloading solidity from github: 0.8.1
Solc 0.8.1 is now available
```

:::info
The `--is-darwin` flag is available and defaults to `true`. Using the value as `false`, it will download the Linux version of the binary.
