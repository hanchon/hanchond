# Stop Chain

To stop a running chain, the command `stop-chain` can be used

## Stop all the nodes

Running the `start-chain` command will stop all the validators associated with the chain.

The command requires an integer as a parameter that represents the chain ID.

```sh
hanchond p stop-chain 1
Chain is stopped
```

:::info
If the node is not running but still in the database, the command will remove the entry from the database and exit correctly.
