# Contract View

The `call-contract-view` command can be used to send an `eth_call` request to a deployed smart contract.

The arguments are:

- Contract Address
- ABI path
- Method name
- Params list

```bash
hanchond playground tx solidity call-contract-view 0x80b5a32E4F032B2a058b4F29EC95EEfEEB87aDcd ./abis/erc20.abi balanceOf --params=a:0x354bF866A4B006C9AF9d9e06d9364217A8616E12
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007d0"}
```
