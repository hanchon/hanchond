# Deploy a Solidity Contract

Before being able to deploy a contract, it needs to be [compiled](/hanchond/playground/tx/solidity/compile)

The command `compile-contract` can be used to compile a `.sol` file.

## File Format

The compiled`.bin` file must have the following format:

```bin
60....
```

## Deploy the Contract

```bash
hanchond playground tx solidity deploy-contract /tmp/CheckAddress.bin
{"contract_address":"0xc2f633d1e91e1a2edeb55274753b44b204a4df91", "tx_hash":"0xa0a473953fb8ff88cbd7f63c956992d2621a7fbc47a6ba59427ef8482a0baf9f"}
```
