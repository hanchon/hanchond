# Compile Solidity Contract

The command `compile-contract` can be used to compile a `.sol` file.

## Compile the file

The `solc` version must be [built](/hanchond/playground/buildSolc) before running the command.

:::info
There are two available flags:

- version: it is used to set the solc version
- output-folder: it is used to set the folder where the compile contract will be stored

:::

```bash
hanchond playground tx solidity compile ./temp/address.sol -v 0.6.12 -o /tmp
Contract compiled at /tmp/address.json
```

:::warning
The `solc` version MUST match the contract pragma.
