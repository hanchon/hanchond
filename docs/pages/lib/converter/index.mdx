# Converter

List of commonly used convert functions

## Base64 to Hex

After getting the Cosmos Block information from the Rest API, the information is encoded using `base64`, but normally the explorers display the information in hex format.

To convert from the API response to the encoding that is usually seen in explorers and wallets, the `Base64ToHexString` function can be used.

```go
proposer, _ := converter.Base64ToHexString(val.Block.Header.ProposerAddress)
hash, _ := converter.Base64ToHexString(val.BlockID.Hash)
```

## Generate Transaction Hash

When reading the API response for a Cosmos Block, you will get every tranasction included the block.

The transaction list is just the content of the transaction encoded using `base64`.

If you want to use the API endpoint to get the transaction logs, you will need the transaction hash.

If you already have the transactions bytes, the `GenerateCosmosTxHash` function can be used.

```go
hash := converter.GenerateCosmosTxHash(txBytes)
```

If the transaction is in `base64`, you can use the function `GenerateCosmosTxHashWithBase64`

```go
hash, err := converter.GenerateCosmosTxHashWithBase64(txBytes)
```

:::info
Note that if you send the transaction in `base64`, the function can error while changing the encoding, so that is why it also returns a possible error

## Remove 0x Prefix from Address

Sometimes when encoding addresses to interact with contracts, you need the value without the `0x` prefix.

The `RemoveHexPrefixFromAddress` function removes the prefix if it's needed.

```go
converter.RemoveHexPrefixFromAddress("0xc5e00d3b04563950941f7137b5afa3a534f0d6d6")
```

:::info
Sending an address without the `0x` prefix will return the same value without any modification.

## Cosmos and Ethereum addresses

### Bech32 to Hex

`Bech32ToHex` converts from cosmos address to Ethereum addresses

```go
addr, err := converter.Bech32ToHex(bech32addr)
```

### Hex to Bech32

`HexToBech32` converts from Ethereum addresses to cosmos address

```go
bech32, err := converter.Bech32ToHex(addr, prefix)
```

## Numbers converter

### Hex String to Decimal

The `HexStringToDecimal` assumes that the value is a valid hex string, with or without the prefix and returns the decimal number in string format.

```go
decimal := converter.HexStringToDecimal("0x1234")
```

### Decimal to Hex String

`DecimalStringToHex` is the inverse process to `HexStringToDecimal`

:::info
The returned value has the `0x` prefix included
:::

```go
hex := converter.DecimalStringToHex("1234")
```
