# Transaction

To create and send transactions, we need some on-chain info, encode the data correctly and broadcast the transaction to the network.

## Send Transaction

The `SendTx` function is the basic function to broadcast Ethereum transactions

```go
txHash, err := t.SendTx(from, to, value, gasLimit, data, privateKey)
```

## Send Transaction To Contract

The `SendTxToContract` function takes care of building the correct transaction and broadcasting it.

```go
txHash, err := t.SendTxToContract(contractName, address, privateKey, value, message, args)
```

:::info
This function is meant to be used just internally by the `InteractWithContract` function.

## Interact with Smart Contracts

This helper function makes it easy to send a transaction to a smart contract, it automatically instantie your wallet based on the `TxBuilder` mnemonic and the account ID.

```go
txHash, err := t.InteractWithContract(contractName, accountID, value, message, args)
```

:::info
The `contractName` variable is the string set in the TxBuilder constructor for the contract.

The `accountID` is the id related to the path of the `mnemonic` usually you just need to use the id `0`

## Deploy a Contract

This helper function makes it easy to send a transaction to deploy a smart contract.

```go
txHash, err := t.DeployContract(accountID, bytecode, gasLimit)
```
