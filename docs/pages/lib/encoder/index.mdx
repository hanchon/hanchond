# Proto Encoder

Helper that includes all the needed interfaces to decode the proto messages included inside the cosmos transactions.

## Decode proto messages

To decode a proto message you just need to instantiate your message object and directly use the `Encoder` object from the `codec` package.

```go
var m authz.MsgExec
err := codec.Encoder.Unmarshal(value, &m)
```

## Decode a complete transaction

To convert the bytes from a transaction to the proto objects, the `BytesToTx` function is included in the `codec` package.

```go
tx, err := codec.BytesToTx(txBytes)
```

### Transaction From the Rest API

If you go the transaction using the Rest endpoint, it will be encoded in `base64`, the function `Base64ToTx` can consume that format directly.

```go
tx, err := codec.Base64ToTx(txInBase64)
```

## Convert a Cosmos Transaction to Ethereum Transaction

When the Ethereum transaction was received using the cosmos endpoints, it will be wrapped inside a protobuf `any` object.

The protobuf object needs to `unmarshalled` to read the signed Ethereum transaction info.

The `ConvertEvmosTxToEthTx` can be used to convert the protobuf object to an Ethereum transaction.

```go
tx, err := codec.ConvertEvmosTxToEthTx(txInBase64)
if err != nil{
    return err
}
txHash, err := tx.Hash().Hex()
```
