# Client

## Builder

To interact with web3 and cosmos endpoints we need a client:

```go
client := requester.NewClient()
```

:::info
The client defaults to Evmos Mainnet
:::

The client exposes a set of setters to change the default endpoints:

- `WithUnsecureWeb3Endpoint(endpoint string)`
- `WithUnsecureCosmosRestEndpoint(endpoint string)`
- `WithUnsecureTendermintRestEndpoint(endpoint string)`

- `WithSecureWeb3Endpoint(endpoint string, auth string)`
- `WithSecureCosmosRestEndpoint(endpoint string, auth string)`
- `WithSecureTendermintRestEndpoint(endpoint string, auth string)`

:::info
The auth string should be the string that goes after the `Authorization` string in the HTTP request, i.e., `Bearer 1337`
:::

## General Requests

### Get

There are two functions exposed, they are mostly used internally:

- `c.SendGetRequestEasyJSON(endpoint, url, res, auth)`: It uses a `easyjson.Unmarshaller` to quickly decode the response
- `c.SendGetRequest(endpoint, url, auth)`: It returns the response as a byte array if the status code is 200

### Post

There is a function exposed, it is mostly used internally:

- `c.SendPostRequestEasyJSON(endpoint, url, res, auth)`: It uses a `easyjson.Unmarshaller` to quickly decode the response

:::info
To unmarshall responses in a quick way with `easyjson`, it requires running the program against the file that has the struct and it'll create the `_easyjson.go` next to it with the required functions.

```sh
easyjson --all lib/types/cosmos/block_cosmos.go
```
