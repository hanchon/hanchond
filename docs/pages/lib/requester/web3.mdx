# Web3 Requester

List of supported rest calls to the Web3 endpoint

## ERC20 Integration

The web3 requester integrates with the [`ERC20` module](/lib/smartcontract/erc20)

The `GetTotalSupply` and `GetBalanceERC20` can be used directly from the `Client`

```go
supply, err := c.GetTotalSupply(contractAddress, height)
balance, err := c.GetBalanceERC20(contractAddress, wallet, height)
```

## GetBlockByNumber

Sending the height and whether you need the transactions or not will return the block data.

```go
c.GetBlockByNumber(height, withTransactions)
```

## GetTransactionTrace

Defaults the tracer to `callTracer`

```go
c.GetTransactionTrace(hash)
```

## GetTransactionReceipt

Gets the receipt for a given transaction hash

```go
c.GetTransactionReceipt(hash)
```

## GetTransactionReceiptWithRetry

Gets the receipt for a given transaction hash, it will use the second argument as the amount of retries.

Between retry attempts the process will wait one second. This function is useful to wait for the transaction to be included in a block.

```go
c.GetTransactionReceiptWithRetry(hash, 10)
```

## Get Nonce

Gets the current nonce for an account

```go
nonce, err := c.GetNonce(address)
```

## GasPrice

Gets current network's gas price

```go
gasPrice, err := c.GasPrice()
```

## NetworkID

Gets network's chain ID

```go
chainID, err := c.ChainID()
```

## Send Transaction

Broadcast the transaction object

```go
txHash, err := c.BroadcastTX(tx)
```
