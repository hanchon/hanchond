# ABI Helpers

## ABI Pack

To simplify the pack of arguments, the `ABIPack` function was created:

```go
callData, err := smartcontract.ABIPack(abiBytes, method, callArgs...)
```

This is meant to be used after reading the `abi` file from disk.

## Strings To ABIArguments

The `StringsToABIArguments` function can be used to convert the strings used in the `cli` to the correct type used by solidity.

```go
callArgs, err := smartcontract.StringsToABIArguments(params)
```

Supported types:

- Address: `a:0x123...`
