# ERC20

This section is meant to be used inside the `requester.Client`, but it can be directly called from the `erc20` package.

## Constructor

To avoid passing the endpoint to each smart contract call, an `ERC20` struct is used

```go
client := erc20.NewERC20("https://proxy.evmos.org/web3")
```

## Getters

The `ERC20` object exposes a couple of functions to get on-chain data:

:::info
All the getters require a height to query the state of the smart contract.

If you need the latest data, use `erc20.Latest` as the height value.
:::

### Total Supply

Total supply returns the total supply of a given smart contract.

```go
supply, err := client.GetTotalSupply(contractAddress, height)
```

### Get Balance

The function `GetContractBalance` returns the token balance of a given wallet.

```go
balance, err := client.GetContractBalance(contractAddress, wallet, height)
```

:::info
You can use the address with and without the `0x` prefix while interacting with these functions.
