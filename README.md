# Hanchond

Hanchon's web3 toolkit

## Docs:

- [docs](https://hanchond.com)

## Requirements:

- `git` to clone the repositories that needs to be build locally
- `go` to build the Evmos client
- `wget` to download the Cosmos-Hub client
- `cargo/rust` to build Hermes

## TODOs:

- Playground queries should use the rest endpoint so the response is in JSON format. That way we can pipe it into `jq` and pipe the result into another query.
